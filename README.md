# TRICC

## Edges

    the edge are in general labeless unless for :
    - after a select multiple: can setup quick rhombus for the number of choice selected, an opperator is required (<>=)
    - after a yes/no quesiton:  'Yes', 'No', 'Follow' (translation can be added in the code )
    - before a calculate to put weight: integer only

### expression
replace the calcualte deducted by inputs
### expression_inputs
adds a calcualte to the one deducted by inputs

### default
not supported yet

### save
will create a calculate with the same name
- obs: observation: save the option as a calcualte obs_[name of the option]
  - can be written obs.[othername].[snomedCode]
- diag: diagnostic/classification save the option as a calcualte diag_[name of the option]
- flag: calculate save the option as a calcualte is_[name of the option]



### name
Mandatory

### label
Not a real property to add, it is simply the text display in the boxes


# notes

## advanced interpretation of the edges:

Activity instances: if there is more that 1 instance of a single actity then the 1+ activity will be displayed only if the previous one were not, to do that the GoTO node are replaced by a path and a rombhus, the path got to the activitvy and rhombus and the next node (if any) are attached to the rhombus that is use to wait that the activity

the node folowing an 1+ activity will be display after the activy OR instead of the activity

Select multiple: if followed by a calculate (rhombus included) the calculate will be equal to the number of selected option BUT opt_none
if not a calculate then relevance will be used unless it is "required" then condition will be at least 1 selection

the Rhombus act as an AND between its imputs and its reference BUT it is an OR beween the inputs
(input1 OR input2 OR input3) AND reference

## start nodes

### Main start

    the flow required at least 1 main start node, but in case of cdss output strategy , several could be used given that they have a 'process' atrribute

    here is the list of the CPG process, this will be the execution oder too:

        - 'registration',
        - 'triage',
        - 'emergency-care',
        - 'local-urgent-care',
        - 'actue-tertiary-care',
        - 'history-and-physical',
        - 'diagnostic-testing',
        - 'determine-diagnosis',
        - 'provide-counseling',
        - 'dispense-medications',
        - 'monitor-and-follow-up-of-patient',
        - 'alerts-reminders-education',
        - 'discharge-referral-of-patient',
        - 'charge-for-service',
        - 'record-and-report'

# Note

## generation of the expressions [get_node_expressions]

### add calcualte:

 - Non or No will generate a negate node
 - save adds a calcualte
 - a rhombus will generate a calcualte in reference unless is is already the case (no left expression too)

### if the node is a calculate [get_node_expression, calculate = true]

    then we calculate based on the previous nodes: [get_prev_node_expression]
        - if a "fake" calculate (Rhombus, exclusion) then get the underlying expression (should not depend of Calcualte = true) [get_calculation_terms]
        - if a Select, manage it as a calculate too (should not depend of Calcualte = true) [get_calculation_terms]
        - else get the expression via  [get_calculation_terms] [get_prev_node_expression , calculate = False] -> get_node_expression for the prev node

### if the node is NOT a calculate [get_node_expression, calculate = false]
